# 🕵️ SQL Murder Mystery

This repository contains my journey solving the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) created by the Northwestern University Knight Lab.

## 🧩 Overview
The mystery begins with a murder in SQL City. Using SQL queries, we track down the killer by exploring a database of clues, witnesses, and events.

## 🗃️ Files
- `mystery_database.sqlite` – the SQLite database provided by Knight Lab.
- `sql/` – contains the step-by-step SQL queries used during the investigation.
- `notes.md` – optional logic/thoughts behind each query.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the SQLite file using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) or any SQLite client
3. Run the SQL queries in order
